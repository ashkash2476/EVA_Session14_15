# Session 14 - Dataset For Monocular Depth Estimation and Segmentation
#  Objective
Create a custom dataset for monocular depth estimation and segmentation simultaneously.

Since we do not have access to a depth camera, we use a pre-trained depth model to generate the depth maps which will be used as the ground truth for our model.
